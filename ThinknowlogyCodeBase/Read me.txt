Thinknowlogy (Thinking - Knowledge - Technology)
------------------------------------------------

Thinknowlogy is grammar-based software,
designed to utilize the intelligence contained within grammar,
in order to create intelligence through natural language in software,
which is demonstrated by:
* Programming in natural language;
* Reasoning in natural language:
	* drawing conclusions,
	* making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
	* asking questions about gaps in the knowledge,
	* detecting conflicts in the knowledge;
* Detection of semantic ambiguity (static as well as dynamic);
* Intelligent answering of "is" questions (by providing alternatives).

How to start:
-------------
When stil packed, unpack the .zip file first in a directory of your choice.

The application comes in two interface types: Java GUI and console interface.
The source code of both versions (Java and C++) is included.
Both applications are almost equal in functionality.
The choice is yours to use either of them:

Thinknowlogy2012r2 in Java.jar
------------------------------
- Java archive, will run on almost any system having Java(TM) 6 or 7 installed;
- This is the more user-friendly version, because handy demo buttons will guide you.

Thinknowlogy2012r2 in C++.exe
-----------------------------
- Console interface;
- When using this executable you need to type the sentences by yourself;
- See the included screenshots for guidance about the accepted grammar;
- The example files can be found in the examples subdirectory.


------------------
Technical details:
------------------
The Java archive:
- is build from the Java source files by Eclipse (Juno SR1);
- needs Java(TM) Runtime Environment 6 or 7 to be installed;
- is tested under Windows XP Home Edition SP3 - using Java 7 Runtime (update 7);
- is tested under Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) - using OpenJDK 7.

The C++ executable:
- is compilable by Code::Blocks 10.05;
- is build from the C++ source files using Visual C++ 2010 Express SP1;
  (see the included build log for the settings);
- is tested under Windows XP Home Edition SP3;
- is tested under Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) - using Wine.


-------------
Known issues:
-------------
- The Java console should have been build using a Model-View-Controller structure;
- The knowledge structure is only created in the work memory of the computer.
  However, a database interface should be added to store the knowledge in a database;
- Under Linux the extraction of some theory directories and files may fail during
  the extraction of this zip-file - due to language specific characters in the
  names. Work-around: Download these files separate from http://mafait.org
 (see: either the design menu or the download page in the English language).


Enjoy playing around with this application, be brave enough to read the analysis and
design papers and have a peek in the source code. And above all: have fun!
