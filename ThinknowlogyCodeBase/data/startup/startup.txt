#	Thinknowlogy is grammar-based software,
#	designed to utilize the intelligence contained within grammar,
#	in order to create intelligence through natural language in software,
#	which is demonstrated by:
#	- Programming in natural language;
#	- Reasoning in natural language:
#		- drawing conclusions,
#		- making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
#		- asking questions about gaps in the knowledge,
#		- detecting conflicts in the knowledge;
#	- Detection of semantic ambiguity (static as well as dynamic);
#	- Intelligent answering of "is" questions (by providing alternatives).
