#	Purpose:	To demonstrate programming in natural language.
#	Version:	Thinknowlogy 2012 (release 2)
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Thinknowlogy is grammar-based software,
#	designed to utilize the intelligence contained within grammar,
#	in order to create intelligence through natural language in software,
#	which is demonstrated by:
#	- Programming in natural language;
#	- Reasoning in natural language:
#		- drawing conclusions,
#		- making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
#		- asking questions about gaps in the knowledge,
#		- detecting conflicts in the knowledge;
#	- Detection of semantic ambiguity (static as well as dynamic);
#	- Intelligent answering of "is" questions (by providing alternatives).

# Show the greeting and cleanup to avoid interference with the next greeting
If the greeting is started then "\n~!'greeting'<a>\"~ ~!'salutation'<a>\"~ ~!'name'<a>`~.\n\n", the age is clear, the gender is clear, the greeting is clear, the martial-status is clear, the name is clear, the salutation is clear and the time is clear.

# Determine the salutation.
If the greeting is started and the gender is male then if the age is assigned and the age is less than 12 then the salutation is "Master" else the salutation is "Mr.".
If the greeting is started and the gender is female then if the martial-status is married then the salutation is "Mrs." else if the age is assigned and the age is less than 12 then the salutation is "Little Miss" else the salutation is "Miss".

# Determine the greet according the time of the day.
If the greeting is started and the time is assigned then if the time is earlier than "06:00" then the greeting is "Good night" else if the time is earlier than "12:00" then the greeting is "Good morning" else if the time is earlier than "18:00" then the greeting is "Good afernoon" else the greeting is "Good evening".
