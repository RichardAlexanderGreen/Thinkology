/*
 *	Thinknowlogy is grammar-based software,
 *	designed to utilize the intelligence contained within grammar,
 *	in order to create intelligence through natural language in software,
 *	which is demonstrated by:
 *	- Programming in natural language;
 *	- Reasoning in natural language:
 *		- drawing conclusions,
 *		- making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
 *		- asking questions about gaps in the knowledge,
 *		- detecting conflicts in the knowledge;
 *	- Detection of semantic ambiguity (static as well as dynamic);
 *	- Intelligent answering of "is" questions (by providing alternatives).
